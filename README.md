# Tic-Tac-Toe, on budget
## Hi! This is the famous game Tic-Tac-Toe, made with C++.
There are three versions here, they only differ in the way they're displayed.

### game1.cpp
This is the smallest version

### game2.cpp
This is a bigger version with a bigger grid and bigger symbols

### game3.cpp
This is the same as game2.cpp but with asterisks instead of lines (less aesthetic in my opinion)

### The executables:
The files 1, 2, and 3 are the compiled versions of game1.cpp, game2.cpp, and game3.cpp respectively. You can run them directly or compile the cpp files again, it doesn't make a difference.
